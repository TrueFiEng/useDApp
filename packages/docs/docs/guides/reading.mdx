# Reading from blockchain

There is a number of useful hooks that you can use to read blockchain state:

- ``useBlockMeta()`` - return meta information (``timestamp`` and ``difficulty``) about most recent block mined
- ``useEtherBalance(address)`` - returns ether balance as BigNumber for given address (or ``undefined``)
- ``useTokenBalance(tokenAddress, address)`` - returns balance of a given token as BigNumber for given address (or undefined)
- ``useTokenAllowance(tokenAddress, ownerAddress, spenderAddress)`` - returns allowance of a given token as BigNumber for given owner and spender address pair (or undefined)

Sooner or later you will want to make a custom call to a smart contract. Use ``useCall`` and ``useCalls`` for that purpose.
See section below on creating custom hooks.

## Custom hooks

Creating a custom hook with the use of our core hooks is straightforward, for example let’s examine the *useTokenBalance* hook.

The hook will retrieve a balance of an ERC20 token of the provided address.

```tsx
  function useTokenBalance(
    tokenAddress: string | Falsy,
    address: string | Falsy
  ) {
    const { value, error } =
      useCall(
        address &&
          tokenAddress && {
            contract: new Contract(tokenAddress, ERC20Interface), // instance of called contract
            method: "balanceOf", // Method to be called
            args: [address], // Method arguments - address to be checked for balance
          }
      ) ?? {};
    if(error) {
      console.error(error.message)
      return undefined
    }
    return value?.[0]
  }
```

Another example is useTokenAllowance hook. Instead of balanceOf, we use allowance on ERC20 interface.

```tsx
  function useTokenAllowance(
    tokenAddress: string | Falsy,
    ownerAddress: string | Falsy,
    spenderAddress: string | Falsy
  ) {
    const { value, error } =
      useCall(
        ownerAddress &&
          spenderAddress &&
          tokenAddress && {
            contract: new Contract(tokenAddress, ERC20Interface),
            method: 'allowance',
            args: [ownerAddress, spenderAddress],
          }
      ) ?? {}
    if(error) {
      console.error(error.message)
      return undefined
    }
    return value?.[0]
  }
```

The *useCall* hook will take care of updating the balance of new blocks.
The results are deferred so that the hook does not update too frequently.

In our custom hooks we can use any standard react hooks, custom react hooks and useDapp hooks.
Rules of hooks apply.

Documentation for hooks is available [here](./core#hooks).


## Using hooks considerations

There are some important considerations when using hooks based on `useRawCall`, `useRawCalls`, `useCall` and `useCalls`.

Avoid using the result of one hook in another.
This will break single multicall into multiple multicalls.
It will reduce performance, generate delays, and flickering for the user.
Instead, try to retrieve needed information in a single call or multiple parallel calls.
That might require modification of smart contracts.
If that is too complex consider using a custom backend or [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/).

## Testing hooks

Let's take ``useTokenAllowance`` as an example.

To write a test, start with a setup code that will create a mock provider and test wallets.

```tsx
  const mockProvider = new MockProvider()
  const [deployer, spender] = mockProvider.getWallets()
```

Before each test, deploy an ERC20 contract. It's important as otherwise the result of one
test could break the other one.

```tsx
  let token: Contract

  beforeEach(async () => {
    const args = ['MOCKToken', 'MOCK', deployer.address, utils.parseEther("10")]
    token = await deployContract(deployer, ERC20Mock, args)
  })
```

After setup, we have to test the hook.

```tsx
  await token.approve(spender.address, utils.parseEther('1'))

  const { result, waitForCurrent } = await renderWeb3Hook(
    () => useTokenAllowance(token.address, deployer.address, spender.address),
    {
      mockProvider,
    }
  )
  await waitForCurrent((val) => val !== undefined)

  expect(result.error).to.be.undefined
  expect(result.current).to.eq(utils.parseEther('1'))
```

To check if the hook reads data correctly, we need to prepare it first. We approve the spender so that we can check if our hook returns the correct value.

To test the hook we need to render it using ``renderWeb3Hook``. It works like ``renderHook`` from the [react-testing-library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/),
but it wraps the hook into additional providers.

React components are asynchronous. Reading data from the blockchain is also an async operation.
To get the return value from the hook, wait for the result to be set. You can do it with ``waitForCurrent``.

Then we can check if our result is correct. ``result.current`` is a value returned from our hook. It should be equal to 1 Ether.


**Full example**

```tsx
  import { MockProvider } from '@ethereum-waffle/provider'
  import { Contract } from '@ethersproject/contracts'
  import { useTokenAllowance, ERC20Mock } from '@usedapp/core'
  import { renderWeb3Hook } from '@usedapp/testing'
  import chai, { expect } from 'chai'
  import { solidity, deployContract } from 'ethereum-waffle'
  import { utils } from 'ethers'

  chai.use(solidity)

  describe('useTokenAllowance', () => {
    const mockProvider = new MockProvider()
    const [deployer, spender] = mockProvider.getWallets()
    let token: Contract

    beforeEach(async () => {
      const args = ['MOCKToken', 'MOCK', deployer.address, utils.parseEther("10")]
      token = await deployContract(deployer, ERC20Mock, args)
    })

    it('returns current allowance', async () => {
      await token.approve(spender.address, utils.parseEther('1'))

      const { result, waitForCurrent } = await renderWeb3Hook(
        () => useTokenAllowance(token.address, deployer.address, spender.address),
        {
          mockProvider,
        }
      )
      await waitForCurrent((val) => val !== undefined)

      expect(result.error).to.be.undefined
      expect(result.current).to.eq(utils.parseEther('1'))
    })
  })
```
