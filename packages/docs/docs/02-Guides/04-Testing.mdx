# Testing

Let's take ``useTokenAllowance`` hook as an example.

## Setup

First of all we'll have to setup local ethereum node and create a provider for it. We should also have access to some accounts on this network with some funds on them. All this can be easily using the [Waffle](https://github.com/TrueFiEng/Waffle) testing library.

```tsx
  import { MockProvider } from 'ethereum-waffle'

  const mockProvider = new MockProvider()
  const [deployer, spender] = mockProvider.getWallets()
```

Next we need to deploy all the neccesary contracts and create a ``useDApp`` config object. ``useDApp`` requires ``Multicall`` contract to be deployed in order to be able to query blockchain. ``@usedapp/core`` package is shipped together with the ``Multicall`` object, that contains all the neccesary data for deployment.

```tsx
  import { MultiCall } from '@usedapp/core'

  const multicall = await deployContract(deployer, Multicall)
```

Now we have to create a ``useDApp`` config object. Let's populate it with the following fields:
  - readOnlyChainId: the default chain that ``useDApp`` queries.
  - readOnlyUrls: this object contains info on how to access specific chains. In this case we're using the ``MockProvider`` object, so we'll pass it to the config object.
  - multicallAddresses: addresses of ``Multicall`` contracts on specific chains. Here we'll use the address of the contract that we deployed before.

```tsx
  const chainId = (await mockProvider.getNetwork()).chainId
  const config = {
    readOnlyChainId: chainId,
    readOnlyUrls: {
      [chainId]: mockProvider
    },
    multicallAddresses: {
      [chainId]: multicall.address
    }
  }
```

:::note

You could also use the ``Multicall2`` contract. It is also exported from the ``@usedapp/core`` package. In this case you would also need to specify ``multicallVersion`` field in your ``config`` object (set it to `2`).

:::

The last step would be to deploy the mock ``ERC20`` token that we'll use in the tests. The ``@usedapp/core`` package exports the token contract that we'll use.

```tsx
  import { MockERC20 } from '@usedapp/core'

  let token: Contract

  const tokenArgs = [
      'MOCKToken', // name of the token
      'MOCK', // symbol of the token
      deployer.address, // address of the token owner
      utils.parseEther('10') // total supply of the token
    ]

  token = await deployContract(deployer, MockERC20)
```

Now we're ready to do the actual testing.

## Testing

To check if the hook reads data correctly, we need to prepare it first. We approve the spender so that we can check if our hook returns the correct value.

To test the hook we need to render it using ``renderDAppHook``. It works like ``renderHook`` from the [react-testing-library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/),
but it wraps the hook with additional contexts used by ``useDApp``. You can also pass the ``config`` object to the ``renderDAppHook`` method - that works in the same way as passing ``config`` to the ``DAppProvider`` component in the regular dApp.

React components are asynchronous. Reading data from the blockchain is also an async operation.
To get the return value from the hook, wait for the result to be set. You can do it with ``waitForCurrent``.

Then we can check if our result is correct. ``result.current`` is a value returned from our hook. It should be equal to 1 Ether.

```tsx
  await token.approve(spender.address, utils.parseEther('1'))

  const { result, waitForCurrent } = await renderDAppHook(
    () => useTokenAllowance(token.address, deployer.address, spender.address),
    {
      config,
    }
  )
  await waitForCurrent((val) => val !== undefined)

  expect(result.error).to.be.undefined
  expect(result.current).to.eq(utils.parseEther('1'))
```

## Full example

```tsx
  import type { Contract } from 'ethers'
  import { useTokenAllowance, Config, MultiCall, ERC20Mock } from '@usedapp/core'
  import { renderDAppHook } from '@usedapp/testing'
  import chai, { expect } from 'chai'
  import { MockProvider, deployContract, solidity } from 'ethereum-waffle'
  import { utils } from 'ethers'

  chai.use(solidity)

  describe('useTokenAllowance', () => {
    const mockProvider = new MockProvider()
    const [deployer, spender] = mockProvider.getWallets()

    let token: Contract
    let config: Config

    beforeEach(async () => {
      const multicall = await deployContract(deployer, MultiCall)
      const chainId = (await mockProvider.getNetwork()).chainId
      config = {
        readOnlyChainId: chainId,
        readOnlyUrls: {
          [chainId]: mockProvider
        },
        multicallAddresses: {
          [chainId]: multicall.address
        }
      }
      const tokenArgs = [
        'MOCKToken',
        'MOCK',
        deployer.address,
        utils.parseEther('10')
      ]
      token = await deployContract(deployer, ERC20Mock, tokenArgs)
    })

    it('returns current allowance', async () => {
      await token.approve(spender.address, utils.parseEther('1'))

      const { result, waitForCurrent } = await renderDAppHook(
        () => useTokenAllowance(token.address, deployer.address, spender.address),
        {
          config,
        }
      )
      await waitForCurrent((val) => val !== undefined)

      expect(result.error).to.be.undefined
      expect(result.current).to.eq(utils.parseEther('1'))
    })
  })
```
