# Ether Transactions

Sending transactions is really simple with useDApp. All we need to send a simple transaction,
is to use [useSendTransaction](/docs/API%20Reference/Hooks#usesendtransaction) hook, which returns a ``sendTransaction`` function and ``state`` object.

See [Transaction Status](./03-Transaction%20Status.mdx) for reference on how to monitor the `state` of a transaction.

You can add additional buffer of gas limit by setting `gasLimitBufferPercentage ` in config or directly in transaction options, see live example below.
It adds 10% of gas limit more to what is estimated by the Ethers library.

**Example**

Simply call a hook in a component.

```tsx
  const { sendTransaction, state } = useSendTransaction()
```

Then when you want to send a transaction, call ``sendTransaction`` for example in a button callback.
Function accepts a [Transaction Request](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/providers/types/#providers-TransactionRequest) object as a parameter.
In example below ``setDisabled(true)`` sets input components to disabled while transaction is being processed (It is a good practice to disable component when transaction is mining).

```tsx
  const handleClick = () => {
    setDisabled(true)
    sendTransaction({ to: address, value: utils.parseEther(amount) })
  }
```

**Live example**

App will send 1 wei to a test account.
Connect a MetaMask wallet **and switch to a test network**, such as Kovan or Ropsten.

import { ExampleContainer } from '/src/examples/ExampleContainer';
import SendTransaction from '../../../example-loader.js!/src/examples/SendTransaction.tsx'

<ExampleContainer example={SendTransaction}/>
